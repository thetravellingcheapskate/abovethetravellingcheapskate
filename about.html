									<h3>Supported by <span class="color">The Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship</span></h3>
									<p>A Gilman Scholarship enables American students to gain proficiency in diverse languages and cultures, skills that are critically important to their academic and career development.</p>
                                    	<p>This is a congressionally funded program of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State and named after the late congressman Benjamin A. Gilman from New York. With his support, the program was established by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000. Shortly thereafter in 2002, Congressman Gilman retired after serving in the House of Representatives for 30 years and chairing the House Foreign Relations Committee. UNCW is committed to developing global citizens who: (1) Demonstrate knowledge of complexity and interconnectedness of environmental, socio-cultural, and geopolitical issues; (2) Communicate effectively within and among diverse cultural groups. (This includes verbal and non-verbal modes of communication.); and (3) Respect cultural differences and embrace common humanity.</p>

								<p>"Study abroad is a special experience for every student who participates. Living and learning in a vastly different environment of another nation not only exposes our students to alternate views, but also adds an enriching social and cultural experience. It also provides our students with the opportunity to return home with a deeper understanding of their place in the world, encouraging them to be a contributor, rather than a spectator in the international community."</p>

										  Valencia is a beautiful city that can trace its history to the Roman republic. The port city of Valencia lies on the southeastern Spanish coast, where the Turia River meets the Mediterranean Sea. It is known for its City of Arts and Sciences, with futuristic structures including a planetarium, an oceanarium and an interactive museum. Valencia also has several beaches, including some within nearby Albufera Park, a wetlands reserve with a lake and walking trails.

										<div class="panel-body">
											Tangier is an important port city in Morocco. The third most populous city in the country, it's a popular entry point to Morocco and Africa as a whole due to its proximity to Spain, and an interesting destination in its own right.The Medina or "Old Town" of Tangier is quite compact compared to the likes in other Moroccan cities. Still, it's easy to lose your orientation in its labyrinths of alleys. Landmarks include the Grand Mosque and several souks or markets. Kasbah, the northwestern part of the medina is made up of the Kasbah or fortification. The main building here is the Dar el-Makhzen that has served as residence for sultans and European colonial lords. Today it is a museum.
											Ville Nouvelle or the "New City" around Boulevard Pasteur is the commercial center of Tangier. Though not an attraction in any sense, it's where to go to find banks, cafés, modern shops and such.

										<div class="panel-body">
											Lisbon is the capital of Portugal situated on seven hills at the wide mouth of the river Tagus(Tejo) where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. With half a million citizens in the city proper and 2.8 million in the Lisbon Region and a thriving mix of Portugal's rich history and vivid contemporary culture, Lisbon enchants travellers with its white bleached limestone buildings, intimate alleyways, and an easy going charm that makes it a popular year round destination. The Lisboa Ask Me Centre, open 09:00-20:00 daily, is the sparkling new centre that will help you find accommodation and the staff there are happy to dispense advice, maps and brochures for whatever you need. The Lisboa Card, which can be purchased from tourist information outlets, offers free use of all public transport in the city and free or reduced price tickets to many museums, galleries and tourist attractions. They can be purchased in 24-hour (€17), 48-hour (€27) and 72-hour (€33) denominations. They are not very good value unless you plan to visit a lot of museums, especially so if you are a holder of a student identification card (international or national) since the student discounts to these attractions are often the same as for the Lisboa Card.

											A beautiful and easygoing city in the southernmost part of Norway, with lots of things to do and see. Despite being the country's capital, it is a relatively small city, so a couple of days will be enough to make your trip enjoyable. Oslo, the capital of Norway, sits on the countrys southern coast at the head of the Oslofjord. It is known for its green spaces and museums. Many of these are on the Bygdøy Peninsula, including the waterside Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Viking Ship Museum, with Viking ships from the 9th century. Another attraction is the Holmenkollbakken is a ski-jumping hill with panoramic views of the fjord.
